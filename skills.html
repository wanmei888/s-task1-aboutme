                        editor, VS Code, streamlines your work by letting you customize it with thousands of add-on features, functions, and themes so the tool you use most looks and works exactly the way you want. Atom was built by Microsoft.</td>

                    <td>Even if you’re freelancing, but especially if you’re part of a team, you need a reliable version control system to keep track of all the changes you make to your code over time. Trust us, at some point you’ll need to check or even
                        revert to an earlier version of your code base! Git is a decentralized version control system which allows everyone on your team to work with the same files in the same project simultaneously without worrying that you might be
                        overwriting someone’s work. It gives developers more freedom to work whenever and wherever since everyone has a local copy of the code.</td>

                        to beautiful. Google Fonts is our favorite front-end asset for the incredible selection it provides for your site typography. And Font Awesome is, well, awesome for the vast array of icons it offers (1,000+ for free and 7,000+
                        on the paid plan). Similarly, Unsplash boasts more than 800,000 high-resolution stock photos you can use, all at no charge and with no copyright hassles.</td>

                        buttons, forms, typography, and other assets so you don’t have to write all that code yourself.</td>

                    <td>CSS is a style sheet language used for styling your web pages. And you can make creating a beautiful site with CSS even simpler with preprocessors. A CSS preprocessor is basically a language that, after it’s processed, gives you even
                        more CSS features. A preprocessor also lets you write code that’s easier to read, maintain, and share—all vital for working on a developer team or even on your own.</td>

                        can simplify your front-end development workflow. But frameworks differ from libraries in that frameworks provide the overall structure (or framework) for sites using JavaScript, while libraries focus on one or more specific aspects
                        of a site.</td>
